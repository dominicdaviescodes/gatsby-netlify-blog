  title: Hi I'm Dom
  description: >
    I got hooked on coding in January 2016 when I completed One Month Rails, I'd
    like to say that I continued learning and got a job as a web developer.
description: Trouble is I've been working in IT most of my career and was about
  to start a job in London which would give me plenty of room to grow and make
  an impact.  And I've been torn ever since.  I've seen lots of people who
  started learning to code back then move on and become web developers.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
